# Cartesian-to-SCARA-Converter
This script will convert gcode from cartesian space to SCARA space


There are better ways to go about doing this, but this way allowed me to stay hardware agnostic until I decided what hardware I would choose.

----------

Update: I forked this project from the original author to change it a little bit, in order to run it in a scara drawbot, using an arduino uno + cnc shield + GRBL firmware (that isnÂ´t able to work native with scara kinematics)
